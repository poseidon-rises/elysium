This is my personal NixOS/Home Manager/NVF config with multiple hosts and users.
It is designed to be extensible with new modules, hosts, and users.

This could not be done without the amazing configurations here:

[Xarvex/dotfyles]: https://github.com/xarvex/dotfyls
[EmergentMind/nix-config]: https://github.com/EmergentMind/nix-config
[flake.nix]: ./flake.nix

- [Xarvex/dotfyles] - A lot of the structure of modules came from here, as well
  as a lot of help from Xarvex himself; I can't thank you enough!

- [EmergentMind/nix-config] - A couple small snippets are stolen from here, for
  doing complex things in elegent ways (check out nixosConfigurations in the
  [flake.nix]). Also a great reference for an advanced configuration without
  custom modules.
